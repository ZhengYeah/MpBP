# MpBP: Verifying Robustness of Neural Networks with Multi-Path Bound Propagation

![mpbp](./mpbp_poster.png)

*Bound propagation* a method for calculating provable lower and upper
bounds of each neuron in a DNN *f*, according to the input region
generated by perturbations. The provable bounds of *f*
are then used to determine whether a misclassification may exist.

MpBP (**M**ulti**p**ath **B**ound **P**ropagaiton) extends classical bound propagation
methods with multiple *propagation paths*.
Multiple propagation paths provides multiple pairs of bounds for a DNN *f*
(see the figure above).
MpBP is based on the widely-used
PyTorch machine learning framework, hence providing efficient
parallel verification on GPUs.
